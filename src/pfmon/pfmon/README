	                 a package to monitor performance

This package provides a tool, called pfmon, which monitors performance
on unmodified binaries or for the entire system. It is using the IA-64 
Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU). This package uses the Linux/ia64 
kernel support for the PMU (perfmon) and the libpfm library.

This version of pfmon supports BOTH the Itanium (Merced) and Itanium2 (McKinley) processors.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

         - YOU MUST at least HAVE kernel v2.4.18 or v2.5.3

	 - As of version 2.0 of the pfmon package, the library, include files, and examples
	   are in a separate package called libpfm-X.Y. This package can be found at the
	   HPLabs FTP site:
			ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/linux-ia64/libpfm-X.Y.tar.gz

	 - you need libpfm-2.0

	 - to recompile pfmon you need the libelf development package

WHAT'S THERE
-------------

	- the pfmon tool (pfmon directory) which collects performance data on unmodified
	  binaries or for the entire system (UP & SMP).

	- a small set of test programs (tests directory) including pfdbg to turn on/off 
	  kernel perfmon debugging. 

	- a simple script (scripts directory) to collect a cycle breakdown using pfmon 
	  on Itanium.

	- a user's guide (docs directory) for pfmon for both Itanium and Itanium2.

INSTALLATION
------------

	- you must have the libpfm package already installed.

	- edit config.mk to :
		- update some variables, such as where to find libpfm and the header files.
		- make your compiler options
		- select which PMU you want to support. Multiple PMU can be supported by a single
		  binary

	- type make
	- type make install
	- you're done, type pfmon --help for a list of options

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

	- extensive documentation with examples is available in the docs subdirectory
	- More up to date information can be found on pfmon web site: http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/perfmon
