pfm_get_pmu_info \- get PMU information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.sp
.BI "int pfm_get_pmu_info(pfm_pmu_t " pmu ", pfm_pmu_info_t *" info ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns in \fBinfo\fR information about a PMU model
designated by its identifier in \fBpmu\fR.

The \fBpfm_pmu_info\fR structure is defined as follows:
.nf
typedef struct {
        const char              *name;
        const char              *desc;
        pfm_pmu_t               pmu;
        int                     size;
        int                     nevents;
        struct {
                int             is_present:1;
                int             reserved:31;
        };
        uint64_t                reserved[3];
} pfm_pmu_info_t;
.fi

The fields of this structure are defined as follows:
.TP
.B name
This is the symbolic name of the PMU. This name
can be used as a prefix in an event string. This is a read-only
string.
.TP
.B desc
This is the description of PMU. This is a read-only string. 
.TP
.B pmu
This is the unique PMU identification code. It is identical to the value
passed in \fBpmu\fR and it provided only for completeness.
.TP
.B nevents
This is the number of available events for this PMU model based on the
host processor. It is \fBonly\fR valid is the \fBis_present\fR field
is set to 1.
.TP
.B is_present
This field is set to one is the PMU model has been detected on the
host system.
.TP
.B size
This field must be set to zero for now. It will be used in case the
\fBpfm_pmu_info\fR structure is expanded.
.PP
The \fBreserved\fR field must be set to zero.

.SH RETURN

If successful, the function returns \fBPFM_SUCCESS\fR and PMU information
in \fBinfo\fR, otherwise it returns an error code.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ERR_NOINIT
Library has not been initialized properly.
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ERR_NOTSUPP
PMU model is not supported by the library.
.TP
.B PFMLIB_ERR_INVAL
The \fBpmu\fR argument is invalid or \fBinfo\fR is \fBNULL\fR or \fBsize\fR
is not zero.
