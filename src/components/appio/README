SUMMARY

    Application I/O component

DESCRIPTION

    This application I/O component enables PAPI-C to determine
    I/O used by the application. This is to be distinguished
    from system-wide I/O statistics. The goal of this component
    is to help the programmer attribute the I/O (read/write) to
    files and sockets, to the source code.

    Listed below are the events measured by the component:

    Event names
    -------------------------
      "READ.BYTES"
      "READ.CALLS"
      "READ.ERR"
      "READ.SHORT"
      "READ.EOF"
      "READ.BLOCK_SIZE"
      "WRITE.BYTES"
      "WRITE.CALLS"
      "WRITE.ERR"
      "WRITE.SHORT"
      "WRITE.BLOCK_SIZE"
      "OPEN.CALLS"
      "OPEN.MAX_FD"
      "OPEN.ERR"
      "SEEK.CALLS"
      "SEEK.ABS_STRIDE"

    The component works by intercepting I/O system calls using the
    library preloading mechanism available in modern operating
    systems. This means that this component WILL NOT COLLECT ANY
    STATISTICS FOR STATICALLY LINKED EXECUTABLES.
