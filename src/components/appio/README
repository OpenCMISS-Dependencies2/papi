SUMMARY

    Application I/O component

DESCRIPTION

    This application I/O component enables PAPI-C to determine
    I/O used by the application. This is to be distinguished
    from system-wide I/O statistics. The goal of this component
    is to help the programmer attribute the I/O (read/write) to
    files and sockets, to the source code.

    Listed below are the events measured by the component:

    Event names
    -------------------------
      "READ_BYTES"
      "READ_CALLS"
      "READ_ERR"
      "READ_SHORT"
      "READ_EOF"
      "READ_BLOCK_SIZE"
      "WRITE_BYTES"
      "WRITE_CALLS"
      "WRITE_ERR"
      "WRITE_SHORT"
      "WRITE_BLOCK_SIZE"

    The component works by intercepting I/O system calls on Linux. At present
    the code uses a features available in libc on Linux, and is unlikely to
    work on other platforms at present. 

    At present the code works for static and dynamic linkage. In the future, 
    if necessary to accomodate a larger number of I/O calls, we may restrict
    support to dynamically linked executables to take advantage of LD_PRELOAD
    for interception.
