ROCM component update: Support for ROCM metrics


Known problems and limitations in early release of metric support
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Only sets of metrics and events that can be gathered in a single
  pass are supported.  Transparent multi-pass support is expected
* All metrics are returned as long long integers


General information
-------------------

The PAPI ROCM component is a hardware performance counter
measurement technology for the AMD ROCM platform which provides
access to the hardware counters inside the GPU. The component is
an adapter fo ROCm profiling library (RPL, 'ROC-profiler') which
is included in standard ROCM release.


How to install PAPI with the ROCM component?
-------------------------------------------- 

This PAPI ROCm componen has been developed and tested using ROCM
release 1.8.

This component uses the ROCM location from the environment (or looks
for /opt/rocm by default). Please set ROCM_DIR and RPL_DIR during
builds so that the component can find the required header files.

Configure PAPI with ROCM enabled.  
    % cd src
    % ./configure --prefix=some_location --with-components="rocm"

Build with ROCM_DIR and RPL_DIR specified
    % export ROCM_DIR=/opt/rocm
    % export RPL_DIR=/opt/rocm/rocprofiler
    % make 

To find a list of ROCM supported events.
    % utils/papi_native_avail | grep rocm

TESTING, for ICL workers
-------------------------------------------- 

These instructions are specific to the ICL environment; but may be useful to
users if translated to their own working or testing environments.

ICL testing was done (March 2019) on the ICL system "caffeine"; which has AMD
equipment installed, and the ROCM interface software installed at /opt/rocm.

The software requires environment variables to be defined. 

A shell script in papi/src/components/rocm/tests/run_papi.sh will export various
environment variables, but (naturally) they go away when the shell exits. If you
want to execute commands and programs from the command line instead, export the 
same environment variables from the command line, but then don't use run_papi.sh.

Note, these paths are specific to the ICL test system  'caffeine'. If you are not
on that system, you will need to find the appropriate rocm directory paths for  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and ROCP_METRICS. For example on another system, we have seen
them installed at /opt/rocm/opencl/lib/x86_64 and /opt/rocm/hsa/lib.

These exports assume you have papi installed in your $HOME directory.
ICLers copy-and-paste these to the command line:

# These ONLY for Caffeine. 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm_src/lib/hsa:/opt/rocm/lib/:$HOME/papi/src/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export ROCP_METRICS=/opt/rocm/lib/metrics.xml
export ROCPROFILER_LOG=1
export HSA_VEN_AMD_AQLPROFILE_LOG=1
export AQLPROFILE_READ_API=1

# THESE for Instinct:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/papi/src/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export ROCP_METRICS=/opt/rocm/rocprofiler/lib/metrics.xml 
export ROCPROFILER_LOG=1
export HSA_VEN_AMD_AQLPROFILE_LOG=1
export AQLPROFILE_READ_API=1
