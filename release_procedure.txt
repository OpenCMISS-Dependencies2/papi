Release Procedure for PAPI  November 21, 2005

Below is a step-wise procedure for making a PAPI release.
This is a living document and may not be totally current or accurate.
It is an attempt to capture current practice in making a PAPI release.
Please update it as appropriate.

One way to use this procedure is to print a copy and check off
the lines as they are completed to avoid confusion.
================================================================================
__ 1. Notify developers that a release is imminent and the repository should be
	considered frozen.
__ 2. Create a ChangeLog for the current release. 
	- One handy way to do this is to use the python script that comes with
	WinCVS:
	  Macros->CVS->Build ChangeLog (advanced).
	Use the -r<branch>: command to log commit messages from the previous 
	branch point to the present.
__ 3. Scan the ChangeLog to remove extraneous fluff, like perfctr imports.

__ 4. Modfy RELEASENOTES.txt to summarize the major changes listed in the log.

__ 5. Check/Change the version number in papi.h, and commit to cvs if needed.

__ 6. Add ChangeLogXYZ.txt to cvs and commit both ChangeLogXYZ.txt and 
	RELEASENOTES.txt.
__ 7. Branch cvs.

__ 8. Export the branch to a clean working directory:
	> cvs export -r <branch> <module> ex:
	> cvs export -r papi-3-2-0 papi
__ 9. Rename the directory from papi to papi-X.Y.Z

__ 10. Delete unneeded directories:
	/src/kev
	/tools/heartbeat
	      /perfGUI
	      /perfometer
	      /vprof
	      /machParam
__ 11. Find a current set of f*.h headers for FORTRAN. These can come from a
	currently built version of the sources, or from another copy of the 
	sources on which you've done a configure / make.
__ 12. Copy the f*.h headers into papi-X.Y.Z/src. This is necessary so that 
	cross-compiled systems like BG/L and Catamount won't need to regenerate
	them.
__ 13. tar the directory:
	> tar -cvf papi-X.Y.Z.tar papi-X.Y.Z
__ 14. zip the tarball:
	gzip papi-X.Y.Z.tar
__ 15. Copy the tarball to icl:/sw/www/icl/projects/papi/downloads

__ 16. Check permissions on the tarball. 664 is good. 

__ 17. Create a link with supporting text on the PAPI software web page.

__ 18. Create a News item on the PAPI Web page.

__ 19. Email the papi developer and discussion lists with an announcement.
