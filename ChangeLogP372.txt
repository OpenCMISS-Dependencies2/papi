	* src/ctests/sdsc4.c [papi-3-7-0] 1.12.2.1:
		Fix from Will Cohen to avoid round-off errors in computing small 
		differences between large numbers, which occasionally resulted 
		in sqrt of negative numbers. Originally applied to sdsc2;

	* src/x86_cache_info.c [papi-3-7-0] 1.4.2.1:
		A fix and an update.
		The computation for AMD L3 cache was incorrect. I was assuming 2^18 was 512K and it really should be 2^19.
		The Intel cache descriptor table was from Nov 2008. I updated it to Aug 2009. This includes 3 fixes and 3 new entries for L3 cache descriptors.
		Tested for compilation/execution only; not for correctness.
		This branch is now identical to HEAD.

		Thanks Will
