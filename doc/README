This directory contains:

A collection of files to aid in the preparation of documentation for PAPI.
The current general philosophy behind PAPI documentation is to provide 
basic documentation in a number of commonly accessible formats.
To do this, the documents are sourced in Microsoft Word '.doc' format,
and then converted to HTML, PDF, and PostScript formats.

Three documents make up the basic collection:

PAPI_USERS_GUIDE.doc	  General overview of using PAPI
PAPI_Prog_Ref.doc	  Specific details on calling individual routines.
			  This file is generated from the man pages 
			  which are found in papi/man/man1 and man3

Production of the PAPI_Prog_Ref.doc file is somewhat complicated.
A number of support files in this directory are involved in this process:

procedure.txt		  Documents the step by step procedure to produce
			  the programmer's reference materials.
papi_progref.pl		  Perl script to convert a man file into pseudo-html
			  to be consumed in the production of the prog_ref.
papiprog.bat		  A Windows batch file to script the conversion of
			  multiple man pages to html.
cat_progref.bat		  A Windows batch file to concatenate individual pages
			  into a single file for import into Word.
progref_template.doc	  A Word template file including macros to provide a
			  formatted framework for the man pages.
